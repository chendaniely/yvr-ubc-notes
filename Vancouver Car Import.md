# Vancouver Car Import

## Things you need:

1.  Your current driving abstract (good to have at least 3 copies)
	- Canada driving whatever may say they can look it up, but they didn't (for me)
	- You need this to show how long you have been driving for, else they just use the issue date of your current license
	- You will need your driver's number and document number on your current license (so take a picture of the front *AND* back of your card)
2. Form 1 Document
	- You can get this at the border, or any of the immigration offices (CBSA - Canada Border Services Agency)
	- You should be able to get this document filled out at the border, but my agent didn't
	- You probably are doing a temporary import, which means you will not be able to *sell* your car in Canada
3. Current driver's license (you will surrender this document)
4. Current vehicle's title (you will surrender this document and get a copy)
5. Current vehicle's registration + insurance
	- probably don't really need this for the importing processing, but you should have these anyway
6. Immigration papers showing status in Canada (work visa, etc)
7. Passport

## What you need to do

1. Go to the CBSA and have them fill out the Form 1 document
	- They should mark your car as a temporary import
	- There should be 2 stamps on this document
	- It will cost you $0 CAD
	- You will need your passport and title documents
2. Go to Driver Licensing Office (Canadian equivalent to US DMV)
	- You will need to apply for a BC driver's license
	- You will surrender your current driver's license (take a picture of BOTH sides - you will need the numbers to get a driving abstract if you forgot)
	- They will ask you for your driving record so give them your driver's abstract (they will take your copy)
		- If you don't have an abstract be prepared to pay much $ for insurance
- Go to an AutoPlan (to register and insure your car with ICBC)
	- They will need your title (they will take it, and should give you a photocopy for your records)
	- Your existing license plate (See if they can check off the 0 or 1 on the Form 1 so you can keep your existing ones!)
	- Your temporary or BC driver's license
	- Hopefully you get your car registered and insured in BC for cheap!
